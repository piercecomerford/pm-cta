#+TITLE:Purity Monitor - Component Testing and Analysis

This repository contains any relevant information involved in testing components for the LoLX LXe purity monitor apparatus. Most of this is extracted from a log I kept in org-mode - if you have a recent version emacs installed it would be most useful to open this repository in emacs and treat it a bit like an iPython notebook. If not, it should be readable on github itself.
